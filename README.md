# Portable Sampler for Textile Triboelectric Nano-Generators (TENGs) Wearable Sensor System

## Overview

Textile triboelectric nano-generators (TENGs) have emerged as a promising solution for wearable self-powered sensing technology. These flexible TENGs exhibit stable output performance under strong deformation and can be utilized as wearable sensors to monitor biomechanical movements. In this internship project, we focused on the conceptualization of a small, portable electronic device capable of harnessing signals produced by TENGs as sensors and processing the acquired data.

## Objectives

The primary goal of this internship was to explore the potential of TENGs as wearable sensors and to design a system that efficiently captures and transmits the biomechanical movement data.

## Challenges and Solutions

Despite the initial aim of achieving self-sustainability for the electronic device using TENGs, practical limitations were encountered. As a result, we decided to design a low-power and low-profile system powered by two single coin batteries. This system is capable of sampling the sensor data and transmitting it to another device with higher processing capabilities, allowing for more efficient real-time data management.

## System Design

The designed system consists of:
- **Textile Triboelectric Nano-Generators (TENGs):** Serving as wearable sensors to capture biomechanical movement data.
- **Low-Power Circuit:** Powered by two single coin batteries, capable of efficiently sampling the sensor data.
- **Data Transmission:** The system transmits captured data to another device with higher processing capabilities for real-time management.

## Future Considerations

Although the current implementation relies on coin batteries for power, future iterations may explore alternative power sources or energy-efficient improvements to enhance device sustainability.

## Usage

To utilize the system:
1. **Wear the TENGs:** Attach the TENGs to the desired wearable locations.
2. **Power On:** Ensure the low-power circuit is powered by two single coin batteries.
3. **Data Transmission:** The system will transmit the captured data to another device for real-time monitoring.

## Conclusion

This internship project lays the foundation for the development of a wearable sensor system utilizing TENGs for biomechanical movement monitoring. While the goal of achieving complete self-sustainability remains a future consideration, the current design provides a practical and efficient solution for real-time data management in everyday and medical environments.
